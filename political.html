        <h1>Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI): A Movement for Change</h1>
        <h2>Foundation of PTI</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), founded by Imran Khan in 1996, emerged as a political party with a mission to bring real change to Pakistan. Initially, PTI struggled to gain significant traction, but over the years, it grew into one of the most influential political forces in the country. The party's primary objective was to fight corruption, ensure justice, and promote equality for all Pakistanis, regardless of their socio-economic status.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Core Values and Vision</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>PTI is built on a strong foundation of social justice, anti-corruption measures, and a commitment to improving governance. Imran Khan’s vision for Pakistan focuses on creating a welfare state, much like the model established by the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in Medina. The party’s key values include:</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> PTI advocates for strict anti-corruption measures, promoting transparency in government and holding public officials accountable.</li>
          <li><strong>Social Welfare:</strong> PTI prioritizes initiatives aimed at poverty alleviation, healthcare, and education, aiming to uplift marginalized communities.</li>
          <li><strong>Economic Stability:</strong> A strong economic policy to reduce Pakistan’s dependency on foreign loans, increase exports, and create employment opportunities for youth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rise to Power</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>PTI's rise to political prominence was not immediate. However, after years of struggling, PTI began to attract support from a younger, educated population who were disillusioned with traditional political parties. In the 2013 general elections, PTI emerged as a major opposition party, and by 2018, Imran Khan's PTI achieved a historic victory, securing enough seats to form the government.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Key Achievements and Programs</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>As the ruling party, PTI has launched several key initiatives aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of Pakistan:</p>
        </div>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Ehsaas Program:</strong> A social protection initiative that focuses on providing financial assistance to the poorest families in Pakistan.</li>
          <li><strong>Kamyab Jawan Program:</strong> A youth empowerment program aimed at providing loans, training, and job opportunities to young Pakistanis.</li>
          <li><strong>Billion Tree Tsunami:</strong> A major environmental initiative aimed at combating deforestation and promoting sustainable development.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Challenges and Opposition</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>Despite its success, PTI has faced significant challenges, including opposition from rival political parties and controversies surrounding its economic policies. However, Imran Khan's leadership has been pivotal in pushing forward reforms and ensuring the party stays true to its mission of combating corruption and promoting justice.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Legacy of PTI</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>PTI’s political journey has reshaped Pakistan’s political landscape. Under Imran Khan’s leadership, the party has become a symbol of hope for those who desire change in Pakistan’s political culture. PTI’s success has shown that with strong leadership, determination, and a clear vision, meaningful change is possible in a nation as complex as Pakistan.</p>
